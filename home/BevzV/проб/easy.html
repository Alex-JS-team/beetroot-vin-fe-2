            <p class="articletext">Cars came into global use during the 20th century, 
                and developed economies depend on them. The year 
                1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern 
                car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his 
                Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available
                 in the early 20th century. One of the first cars 
                 accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an
                  American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
                   Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they
                    replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but
                     took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe 
                     and other parts of the world.</p>

            <p class="articletext">Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger
                 comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades,
                  additional features and controls have been added 
                  to vehicles, making them progressively more complex,
                   but also more reliable and easier to operate.</p>
